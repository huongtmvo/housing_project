This is the project I did for my IBM's Statistical for Data Science with Python on Coursera.

In this project, I used previous dataset on Boston's housing prices from U.S. Census Service to derive new insights in order to help business make an informed decision.
- Perform descriptive statistics to gain understanding of the data
- Create data visualization using seaborn library
- Perfom hypothesis testing and regression analysis using scipy.stats, statsmodels
